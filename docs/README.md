Quick IdpBuilder notes:
- Synthesize packages: from `cdk8s/` run `npx ts-node main-v2.ts`.
- Deploy all packages: `idpbuilder create --package cdk8s/dist/`.
- Gitea token for API work:
  - `idpbuilder get secrets -p gitea -o json | jq -r '.[0].data.token'`

For details on `cnoe://` packaging, Gitea mirroring, and ArgoCD Application shapes, see CDK8s Architecture and Packaging.
