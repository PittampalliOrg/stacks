# Kargo-Gitea Integration Summary

## Successfully Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed yaml-update Path Syntax Issue ✅
- **Problem**: Kargo pipeline was failing with "key path not found" error when trying to update container images
- **Root Cause**: Kargo uses sjson library which requires dot notation for array indexing
- **Solution**: Changed path from `spec.template.spec.containers[0].image` to `spec.template.spec.containers.0.image`
- **File Modified**: `/home/vpittamp/stacks/cdk8s/charts/kargo-backstage-pipeline-chart.ts`

### 2. Configured Kargo Webhook Receivers ✅
- **Added webhook receiver** to ProjectConfig for receiving Gitea webhook events
- **Generated secure webhook secret**: `lwxtOFx10Jrox11Zi40r3L3zEvR6J8q9`
- **Created Ingress** for external webhooks at `kargo-webhooks.cnoe.localtest.me:8443`
- **Webhook URL**: `https://kargo-webhooks.cnoe.localtest.me:8443/webhooks/github/661cf0989545b1bd92b763966c09315f5e6fa5d0b48e79ee79fa983acde57967`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/home/vpittamp/stacks/cdk8s/charts/kargo-pipelines-project-chart.ts`
  - `/home/vpittamp/stacks/cdk8s/charts/kargo-helm-chart.ts`

### 3. Automated Gitea Webhook Setup ✅
- **Created CDK8s chart** for automated webhook configuration via Kubernetes Job
- **Added gitea-credentials secret** with API token for webhook setup
- **Implemented CronJob** for periodic webhook verification (every 6 hours)
- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `/home/vpittamp/stacks/cdk8s/charts/kargo-gitea-webhook-setup-chart.ts` (new)
  - `/home/vpittamp/stacks/cdk8s/charts/kargo-gitea-credentials-chart.ts` (modified)
  - `/home/vpittamp/stacks/cdk8s/config/applications.ts` (modified)

## Technical Details

### Gitea API Token
- **Token**: `808ee2f2ddf7b277f1a539f310b8ef4b8ee18612`
- **User**: `giteaAdmin`
- Stored in `gitea-credentials` secret in `kargo-pipelines` namespace

### Webhook Configuration
- **Type**: GitHub-compatible (Gitea mimics GitHub API)
- **Events**: Configured for push, create, delete, release, and package events
- **TLS Verification**: Disabled (for self-signed certificates)

### Known Issues
- Gitea system webhooks API doesn't properly set events array (shows empty even when configured)
- This appears to be a Gitea API limitation, but webhooks should still trigger

## Testing the Integration

1. **Verify webhook exists**:
   ```bash
   curl -k -X GET "https://gitea.cnoe.localtest.me:8443/api/v1/admin/hooks" \
     -H "Authorization: token 808ee2f2ddf7b277f1a539f310b8ef4b8ee18612"
   ```

2. **Test webhook trigger**:
   - Push a new image to Gitea registry
   - Check Kargo UI for new freight detection
   - Verify promotion pipeline triggers

3. **Monitor webhook logs**:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n kargo deployment/kargo-external-webhooks-server
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Test end-to-end flow by pushing an image to Gitea
2. Monitor Kargo warehouse for freight detection
3. Verify automated promotions work as expected
4. Consider implementing webhook retry logic if needed
